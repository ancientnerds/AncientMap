### Twitter/X Thread Starter
```
🏛️ I built a platform to explore 800,000+ archaeological sites from 30+ databases — all in one place.

After months of work, ANCIENT NERDS is now live and open source.

Here's what it can do 🧵

### LinkedIn Post
```
Excited to share a project I've been working on: ANCIENT NERDS — an open-source platform aggregating 800,000+ archaeological sites from 30+ global databases.

Why? Archaeological data is fragmented across dozens of incompatible platforms. Researchers spend hours cross-referencing. Students can't easily explore connections between civilizations.

ANCIENT NERDS solves this with:
✅ Unified search across all sources
✅ Interactive 3D globe visualization
✅ Historical empire overlays (44 civilizations)
✅ Paleoshoreline visualization (Ice Age to present)
✅ AI-powered natural language search
✅ Offline mode for fieldwork

It's free, open source, and built for researchers, educators, and history enthusiasts.
