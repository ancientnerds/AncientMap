## The Problem That Started Everything

We've always been fascinated by ancient history. But every time we tried to explore archaeological sites, we hit the same wall: **where do you even start?**

There's no single place to get a high-level view of what's out there. Want to see what ancient sites exist in a region? You'd need to know which specialized databases to search — and there are dozens of them. Pleiades for the Mediterranean. DINAA for North America. UNESCO for World Heritage sites. Each valuable, but overwhelming for someone just trying to get oriented.

The real problem isn't just fragmented data — it's the lack of a good **entry point**. Students, enthusiasts, and even researchers need a way to see the big picture first, then dive deeper into specialized sources.

So we built one.

## Introducing ANCIENT NERDS Map

**ANCIENT NERDS** is an open-source research platform designed to be your **starting point** for exploring the ancient world. See what's out there, discover patterns, and find the specialized sources you need to dive deeper.

The platform today:
- **5,000+** archaeological sites to explore
- **44** historical empire overlays
- **157** paleoshoreline depth levels
- Links to authoritative sources for further research

The goal isn't to replace specialized databases — it's to help you discover them. Every site links back to its original sources, so you always know where to go for more detail.

## Time Travel: See History Unfold

One feature we're particularly proud of is the historical overlay system.

We wanted to see archaeological sites in their historical context — to understand which ancient ruins once stood within the borders of great empires, and which lay beyond. Reading about the Roman Empire is one thing, but seeing its boundaries stretched across the Mediterranean while exploring the sites within gives you a completely different sense of scale.

Toggle between **44 historical empire boundaries** spanning from ancient Mesopotamia to colonial-era powers. Watch the Inca Empire hug the Andes, or see where Byzantine and Sassanid territories met. It brings the ancient world into focus in a way that lists and textbooks simply can't.

## What Did Earth Look Like 20,000 Years Ago?

Here's something that keeps surprising people: coastlines change.

During the Last Glacial Maximum (around 20,000 years ago), sea levels were approximately **120 meters lower** than today. Land bridges connected continents. Britain was attached to Europe. Australia had vastly different shores.

Understanding where ancient peoples lived means understanding where the land actually was.

ANCIENT NERDS includes **157 paleoshoreline depth levels** — a slider that lets you visualize how coastlines have changed over the past 20,000 years. It's not just cool; it's essential for understanding migration patterns, settlement locations, and why certain "coastal" sites are now underwater.

## Bringing Sites to Life

We didn't want just dots on a map. We wanted to feel the sites.

Each location in ANCIENT NERDS serves as a launchpad for deeper research:
- **Photographs** from Wikipedia and other sources
- **Detailed descriptions** and historical context
- **Direct links** to authoritative databases for further study
- **3D models** via Sketchfab integration

That last one is special. For major sites like Machu Picchu, you can explore actual 3D reconstructions — and then follow links to the specialized sources when you're ready to dig deeper.

## Built for Real Research

Early feedback from researchers shaped many features:

### Powerful Filtering
Filter by **age** (from prehistory to modern era), **country** (91 flags to choose from), **category** (49 site types), or **source database** (all 30+ included).

![Age filter slider](../screenshot/Screenshot%202026-01-27%20195023.png)
*Filter sites by age — from 5000 BC to 1500 AD and beyond*

![Country filter with 91 flag badges](../screenshot/Screenshot%202026-01-27%20195048.png)
*91 countries, 91 flags — filter by geographic region*

![Category filter showing 49 types](../screenshot/Screenshot%202026-01-27%20195114.png)
*49 site categories — from temples to tombs to trade routes*

### Proximity Tools
"Find all sites within 50km of this location" — a surprisingly common research need that most databases don't support well.

![Proximity search with radius slider](../screenshot/Screenshot%202026-01-27%20194914.png)
*Proximity search: find all sites within your specified radius*

### Distance Measurement
Need to know how far Teotihuacan is from Chichen Itza? Point, click, measure.

![Distance measurement tool showing 3207.3 km](../screenshot/Screenshot%202026-01-27%20194957.png)
*Measure distances between any two points on the globe*

### Offline Mode
No internet in the jungle? No problem. Download layers, empire boundaries, and site data for fieldwork.

## Meet Lyra: Your AI Archaeology Assistant (Experimental)

The next step was obvious: **what if you could just ask questions?**

Lyra is ANCIENT NERDS' AI-powered research assistant. Ask natural language questions like:
- "What Roman temples exist near the Rhine?"
- "Show me Neolithic sites in Scotland"
- "Find underwater archaeological sites in the Mediterranean"

Lyra helps you discover sites and find where to learn more, using semantic understanding rather than just keyword matching.

**Note:** Lyra is currently experimental and available only to selected community members as we refine the experience. Interested in early access? Join our community and let us know.

*Meet Lyra — ask questions in plain language, get archaeological answers (experimental feature)*

## Open Source & Community-Driven

Archaeological knowledge belongs to everyone. That's why ANCIENT NERDS is **fully open source**.

The platform includes a **user contribution system** — the Wikipedia model for archaeology. Found a site that's not in the database? Submit it. Have better coordinates for an existing location? Help improve it.

![Contribute a Site form](../screenshot/Screenshot%202026-01-27%20195441.png)
*Community contributions: help expand the archaeological record*

### Tech Stack (for the curious)
- **Frontend**: React + Three.js for 3D globe rendering
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS
- **AI**: Custom semantic search pipeline

---

## What's Next

We're currently in **public beta** — the core features are working, but we're actively improving based on community feedback. Here's what's on the roadmap:
- **More data sources** — integrating additional archaeological databases
- Mobile app for fieldwork
- Enhanced collaboration features
- Additional historical layers
