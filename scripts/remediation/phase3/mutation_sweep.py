"""Mutation proofs for the discover pass (piece 5) and its question.

For every guard: back the file up, break exactly that guard, run the one test that is supposed to
catch it, restore, and prove the restore is byte-identical (sha256). Nothing here uses git.

**Run this from a parent process, never from inside a subagent lane.** A lane that is killed on its
30-minute ceiling between applying a mutation and restoring it leaves the mutant in the working tree,
and the tree then looks like finished work - which is exactly what happened to piece 5 (`runs/gold`,
2026-09-21: `snapshot_plan.py` was delivered with mutation 3 still applied). The sweep restores
cleanly when it is allowed to finish; the hazard is being killed mid-flight.
