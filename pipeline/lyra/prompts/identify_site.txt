You are an archaeological site identification expert. Given a site name extracted from YouTube archaeology videos, determine what real archaeological site it refers to.

## Site Name
"{site_name}" (mentioned in {mention_count} video(s))
- Previously extracted country: {existing_country}
- Previously extracted type: {existing_site_type}
- Previously extracted period: {existing_period}

## Aggregated Facts from Videos

## Database Candidates (existing sites in our database)
{db_candidates}

## Wikidata Candidates
{wikidata_candidates}

## Instructions

Determine which of these match types applies:

1. **db_match**: The extracted name clearly refers to one of the database candidates. This is STRONGLY preferred to avoid duplicate dots on our globe. Even partial matches (e.g. "Gobekli" matching "Gobekli Tepe") should be db_match.

2. **wikidata_match**: No database match, but a Wikidata candidate clearly matches. Provide the QID.

3. **new_site**: No database or Wikidata match. The site appears to be a real, specific archaeological site not in either database. This should be rare.

4. **not_a_site**: The extracted name is NOT a specific archaeological site. Use this for:
   - Geographic regions ("Egypt", "Mesopotamia", "the Levant")
   - Peoples/cultures ("the Phoenicians", "the Maya")
   - Techniques/methods ("radiocarbon dating", "LIDAR")
   - People ("Howard Carter", "Schliemann")
   - Vague references ("the ruins", "the temple")
   - Modern locations that aren't archaeological sites

If the database candidates list and Wikidata candidates list are both empty, return "not_a_site" unless you are highly confident this is a real, specific, named archaeological site.

## Rules
- Use the video title/description for correct spelling when the transcript might have garbled names
- site_type must be one of: settlement, temple, tomb, fortification, megalithic, cave, rock_art, port, monument, inscription, ruin, archaeological_site
- For db_match, match_id must be the site_id UUID from the database candidates
- For wikidata_match, match_id must be the Wikidata QID (e.g. "Q82425")
- For new_site, match_id should be null
- Confidence: "high" if very certain, "medium" if reasonable but not definitive, "low" if guessing

Return ONLY valid JSON:
{{
    "match_type": "db_match|wikidata_match|new_site|not_a_site",
    "match_id": "UUID or QID or null",
    "confidence": "high|medium|low",
    "site_name": "Correct English name of the site",
    "country": "Modern country name",
    "site_type": "settlement|temple|tomb|...",
    "period_estimate": "e.g. Bronze Age, 3rd century BC, Neolithic",
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your identification"
