Verify this tweet against a specific segment of the transcript.

Tweet to verify:
{tweet_content}

Relevant transcript segment (roughly from {timestamp}):
{transcript_segment}

Verify:
1. All claims are supported by the transcript segment
2. Names, dates and numbers are correct
3. Quotes, if used, are exact matches
4. If a site name is mentioned, verify the spelling matches the transcript
5. If a time period is claimed, verify it against the transcript context

Rules:
- Prefer VERIFY_AS_IS. Only MODIFY for genuinely wrong facts (wrong dates, wrong names, wrong claims).
- modified_text MUST be a standalone tweet under 220 characters. If you cannot fix it that concisely, REJECT instead.
- NEVER reference "the transcript", "the audio", "the speaker", or "the segment" in modified_text.
- Keep the original tweet style — short, punchy, no hedging or caveats.
- If a name sounds garbled in the transcript but the tweet's interpretation is reasonable, VERIFY_AS_IS.
- Prefer REJECT over a MODIFY that adds hedging language or destroys the tweet format.

Find the exact second where the claim is discussed and return a single timestamp (MM:SS).
