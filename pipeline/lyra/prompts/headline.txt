1. An engaging, curiosity-sparking headline that captures the most interesting discoveries
2. A 2-3 sentence TLDR summary
3. Engaging subheadings for each paragraph

Use this format:
[HEADLINE]
Your headline here

[TLDR]
Your TLDR here without TLDR headline, the summary only.

[SUBHEADS]
1. First subhead
2. Second subhead
(etc.)
