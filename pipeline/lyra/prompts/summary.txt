Requirements:
- Extract EXACTLY {topic_limit} key topics
- Prioritize: discoveries, dates, site details, methodologies, context, artifact descriptions
- Use exact timestamps [MM:SS] format
- Ensure JSON valid and well-formatted
- Double fact check especially names, dates and numbers

primary_site rules:
- Only fill primary_site if the topic is PRIMARILY ABOUT a specific named archaeological site
- "confidence": "high" if the topic centers on this site, "medium" if mentioned significantly but not the main focus
- Set primary_site to null if: the topic is about a technique/method, a general region/empire, multiple sites equally, or no specific site is discussed
- Use the site's most common English name (e.g. "Pompeii" not "Pompei", "Gobekli Tepe" not "Gobeklitepe")
- If the video title or description mentions specific site names, use those for the correct spelling
- Do NOT fill for vague references like "somewhere in Egypt" or "a site in Turkey"
- site_type must be one of: settlement, temple, tomb, fortification, megalithic, cave, rock_art, port, monument, inscription, ruin, archaeological_site
- approximate_period: use standard archaeological period names or century notation

Exclude: Personal anecdotes, off-topic, technical difficulties, channel promotions, audience interactions
